# scioto
A miscellaneous collection of things I keep reusing over and over.

There's no particular rhyme or reason to these, only that I keep using them in multiple projects.

I am working only on the 3.6 branch, which requires Python 3.6.

Where does the name `scioto` come from? It's the name of the river flowing through Central Ohio.
